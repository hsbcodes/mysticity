    <p> K.C. Melekyan is the idea behind Mysticity. He has been pursuing this project for quite a while, and it consumed “lots of life,” as he says . K.C. is an educator. He currently works with high school students. His main hobby is writing music. Occasionally he writes poems and essays. He has co-founded Tessilck in 1983. Melekyan plays guitars and keyboards. “I wish I could play more instruments to be able to implement all my ideas. Alas it is too late,” he says.
